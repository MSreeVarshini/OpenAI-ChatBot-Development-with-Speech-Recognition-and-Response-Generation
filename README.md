# OpenAI-ChatBot-Development-with-Speech-Recognition-and-Response-Generation

Inspired by Avengers... I named my chatbot as JARVIS... 

This project explores the development of a conversational AI chatbot utilizing OpenAI's capabilities for natural language processing and response generation. The chatbot integrates speech recognition for user input and text-to-speech for voiced responses, creating a human-like conversational experience.

### Features:

* Speech Recognition: Leverages speech recognition libraries to convert user spoken language into text.
* OpenAI Integration: Employs OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model to understand user queries and generate natural language responses.
* Text-to-Speech: Utilizes text-to-speech functionality to convert generated responses back into spoken audio for the user.


### Technologies Used:

* Python (programming language)
* Speech Recognition Library (e.g., SpeechRecognition)
* OpenAI API
* Text-to-Speech (e.g., macOS say command)

### How to Run

#### Prerequisites:

* Python 3.x installed
* Speech recognition library installed (e.g., pip install SpeechRecognition)
* OpenAI API key (obtain from https://platform.openai.com/signup)

#### Steps:

* Clone this repository.
* Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt (if a requirements.txt file exists)
* Set your OpenAI API key in the config.py file (create one if it doesn't exist).

#### Usage:

The chatbot will listen for user input through speech recognition. Speak your query, and the chatbot will process it using OpenAI and respond with a generated text message that is spoken back to you.

#### Additional Notes:

* This is a basic implementation and can be further extended with features like sentiment analysis, topic tracking, or integration with external APIs.
* Error handling and exception management can be improved for a more robust user experience.
* Consider exploring advanced NLP techniques to enhance the chatbot's understanding and response capabilities.
